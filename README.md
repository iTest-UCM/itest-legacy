===========

This repsitory contains the **legacy** version of the iTest application. This repository has been created for historical purposes.

iTest was first created and developed in 2006 by a group of teachers and students from Universidad Complutense de Madrid in Aranjuez.

The tool allows the on-line evaluation of test exams where questions and answers may include mathematical formulae and multimedia contents.
